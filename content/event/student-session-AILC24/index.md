summary: An opportunity to show my MSc thesis study during the Student Session at the AILC Lecures 2024.
abstract: 'My thesis explores the Survey Questionnaire Generation task in the Human Resource Management field. Although poorly explored and characterized by the lack of dedicated materials, this study overcame such limitations by proposing a comprehensive methodology. Therefore, we proposed a dataset collecting survey questionnaires for HRM, which was used to leverage the capabilities of LLMs, namely GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo, in such a task.'
