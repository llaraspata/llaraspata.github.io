      Leveraging the capabilities of Large Language Models in Questionnaire Generation for Human Resource Management

      My thesis explores the Survey Questionnaire Generation task in the Human Resource Management field. Although poorly explored and characterized by the lack of dedicated materials, this study overcame such limitations by proposing a comprehensive methodology. Therefore, we proposed a dataset collecting survey questionnaires for HRM, which was used to leverage the capabilities of LLMs, namely GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4-Turbo, in such a task.

      Computer Vision techniques for Violence Recognition

      My thesis focused on the application of PoseConv3D to Violence Recognition, a sub-domain of Activity Recognition. We trained it onto four datasets to perform a binary classification. The videos collected in the involved datasets were pre-processed in order to extract the poses to reduce the bias induced by the backgroud of the scenes.

#      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep #learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s #architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This #is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the #functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.
